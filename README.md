**Visualizations:**

Countplots have been extensively used to visualize the distribution of categorical variables, providing insights into the frequency of various events or occurrences. The groupby function has been applied to aggregate data based on specific criteria, revealing patterns and trends within different groups.

**Conclusion and Key Insights:**

Based on the analysis, it is observed that women who are married and fall within the age group of 26-35 years from Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation industries, are more likely to purchase products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories during the Diwali season.
